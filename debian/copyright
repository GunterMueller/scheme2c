  (Copyright was changed 4/28/08.  Note that I did not change the copyright
  messages included in various examples, in spite of the fact that the copyright
  holder was changed from DEC to HP. If someone wants to fix the initial
  prompt in various examples in the documentation, feel free ...  Hans Boehm)

The documentation includes a copy of the R4RS manual, which states:

  We intend this report to belong to the entire Scheme community, and
  so we grant permission to copy it in whole or in part without fee.
  In particular, we encourage implementors of Scheme to use this
  report as a starting point for manuals and other documentation,
  modifying it as necessary.

  It was written and edited by:

The R4RS sources include a LaTeX style file, algol60.sty, which states

  % Copyright (C) 1985 by Leslie Lamport
  % Hacked To Death (H) 1986 by Jonathan Rees from Lamport's REPORT and
  %   REP11 document styles

This style file appears to be covered by the same permissive grant
that covers the remainder of the R4RS manual LaTeX source.
