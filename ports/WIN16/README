Scheme->C for Microsoft Windows 3.1

Scheme->C for Microsoft Windows 3.1 is implemented as a DLL that can be
invoked by an application to interpret Scheme expressions.  The application
interface to Scheme->C is described in doc/embedded.mss.

One need not rebuild the DLL from the Scheme->C source as binaries are
included in the release:

	ports/WIN16/embedded.exe - a QuickWin application program that
	provides an interactive interface to the Scheme->C DLL.

	ports/WIN16/scheme2c.dll - a DLL containing the Scheme interpreter,
	runtime, and application interface.

The previous two files were compiled for debugging by CodeView.  Optimized
versions of these programs (without debug information) are found in
ports/WIN16/release\embedded.exe and ports/WIN16/release\scheme2c.dll.

The programs are built using Microsoft C 7.0 and the Programmer's Workbench.
The steps involved are:

	1. Transfer WIN16/server/* to the directory c:\scheme2c on the
	   Windows system.

	2. Using the programmer's workbench, open the project scheme2c.mak
	   and build scheme2c.dll.  Open the project embedded.mak and build
	   embedded.exe.  Optimized versions of each of these files are
	   built by changing the build options on each project and rebuilding
	   the files.

To extend the Scheme->C DLL, replace the file scrtuser.c, add additional C
files to the project, and then rebuild the DLL.

To run the test programs, copy WIN16/test/alltests.sc and test20-input.sc to
the Windows system.  Run embedded.exe as follows:
